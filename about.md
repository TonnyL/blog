# About Me

My name is Li Zhao Tai Lang (黎赵太郎) a.k.a TonnyL. 24 years old.

## Background

I was born and raised up in [Zhangjiajie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiajie) and finished my college in Changsha. I majored in Software Engineering at Changsha University of Science & Technology. By now, I am an Android developer.

BTW, Zhangjiajie is a tourism city which is of beautiful natural sceneries, and I strongly suggest you going there and enjoying the gift of earth.
